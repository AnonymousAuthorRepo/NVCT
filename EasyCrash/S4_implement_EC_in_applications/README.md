User can manully implement EasyCrash into application. The different modification on application between step 3 and step 4 is that user can disable persist operation from every code region and only keep persist operation on code region selected in step 3.

The persist operation `EC` provided by EasyCrash is in folder "my_include".

Folder `EashCrash_example` shows the example of implementation of EasyCrash.
